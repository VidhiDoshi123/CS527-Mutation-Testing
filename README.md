# CS527 Project- Mutation Testing

**Mutation Testing** is a technique through which we bring artificial changes to the source code in order to enable the test suite to detect those changes. In this project we plan to implement a tool that can implement all the mutators available with Pitest tool and perform mutation testing on the jsoup project.



## Getting started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run mvn test, to verify the code is in its original state.
2. Run CodeModifierTest.java file.
3. Run mvn surefire:test.
4. Run  mvn surefire-report:report-only , to generate the report.
